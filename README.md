# TritonMacroPlacer

ParquetFP based macro cell placer for OpenROAD.

## Flows
* Input: Initial placed DEF of a mixed-size (macros + cells) netlist. Such a DEF is produced by RePlAce (timing-driven, mixed-size mode, aka "TD-MS-RePlAce").
* Output: A placed DEF with macro placements honoring halos, channels and cell row "snapping".  Approximately ceil((#macros/3)^(3/2)) "sets" corresponding to quadrisections of the initial placed mixed-size DEF are explored and packed using ParquetFP-based annealing. The best resulting floorplan according to a heuristic evaluation function is returned.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisite
* GCC compiler and libstdc++ static library >= 4.8.5
* boost library >= 1.41
* bison (for lef/def parsers) >= 3.0.4
* tcl (for OpenSTA) >= 8.4
* Recommended OS: Centos6, Centos7 or Ubuntu 16.04
