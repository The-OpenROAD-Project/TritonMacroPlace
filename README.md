# TritonMacroPlacer

ParquetFP based macro cell placer for OpenROAD.

## Flows
* Input: Initial placed DEF of a mixed-size (macros + cells) netlist. Such a DEF is produced by RePlAce (timing-driven, mixed-size mode, aka "TD-MS-RePlAce").
* Output: A placed DEF with macro placements honoring halos, channels and cell row "snapping".  Approximately ceil((#macros/3)^(3/2)) "sets" corresponding to quadrisections of the initial placed mixed-size DEF are explored and packed using ParquetFP-based annealing. The best resulting floorplan according to a heuristic evaluation function is returned.

## How to Download and Build?
- If you want to use this as part of the OpenROAD project you should build it and use it from inside the integrated [OpenROAD app](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD). The standalone version is available as a legacy code in [standalone branch](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/TritonMacroPlace/tree/standalone).
- For OpenROAD-flow users, manuals for released binaries are available in readthedocs. [(Getting-Started)](https://openroad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/getting-started.html)
- For developers, manuals for building a binary is available in OpenROAD app repo. [(OpenROAD app)](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD) 
- Note that TritonMacroPlace is a submodule of OpenROAD repo, and take a place as the **"macro_placement"** command. 


## OpenROAD Tcl Usage (global_placement)

```
macro_placement -global_config <global_config_file>
```
* __global_config__ : Set global config file loction. [string]

### Global Config Example
```
set ::HALO_WIDTH_V 1
