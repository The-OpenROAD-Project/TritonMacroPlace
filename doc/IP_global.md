#### Global halo Width for vertical edge of macros. 
* This is halo width value to be used for each IP along the vertical edge. This is essential to ensure proper routing to macro pins.

      set ::HALO_WIDTH_V 2

#### Global halo Width for horizontal edge of macros. 
* This is halo width value to be used for each IP along the horizontal edge. This is essential to ensure proper routing to macro pins.

      set ::HALO_WIDTH_H 2
  
#### Global channel width for vertical edge of macros. 
* This is channel width value to be used for each IP along the vertical edge. This is essential for buffer placement and PDN connectivity of these cells.

      set ::CHANNEL_WIDTH_V 25
  
#### Global channel width for horizontal edge of macros.
