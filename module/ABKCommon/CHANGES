// 970901 ilm    completely reworked the timer class to circumvent the
//                 wrap-around problem on all platforms and provide separate
//                 user/system time readings on "better supported" platforms
                   (see below)
// 970901 ilm    even though class Timer is (expectected to be) completely
//                 portable, it has "better supported" platforms (currently
//                 __SUNPRO_CC). This means that platform-specific calls will
//                 be used instead of common functions to provide better
//                 granularity of time readings and circumvent the wrap-around
//                 problem
//                    However, the effect of the wrap-around problem should
//                 be minimal on other platforms too. The only precaution 
//                 for users of "other" platforms (i.e. not _SUNPRO_CC)
//                 is not to use Timer::expired() after the time wrap-around
//                 period of (INT_MAX+0.0)/CLOCKS_PER_SEC sec (can be 36sec)
//                 use realTimeExpired() instead.

 3.0 970923 ilm  added abk_dump_stack()  (does nothing on unsupported platforms)
                 abkfatal() and abkassert() now call it #ifdef ABKDEBUG
 3.1 970924 ilm  added #include "pathDelims.h" and deleted equivalent functnlty

 3.1 971009 mro  extensive changes to random-number generation.  Please
                 see README.rnd in this directory

 3.2 971113 mro  Added seed logging to random-number package.  See
                 README.rnd in this directory.

     971114 mro  Added Cleaner class to call SeedHandler::clean()
                  automatically; removed "Old" random kernel

                   resp. modifications to Makefile and regression

 3.4 971130 msm  added code for memory estimates into platfDepend.cxx

 3.4 971130 ilm  reworked clas MemUsage() to give readings
                   of both peak memory and estimated memory usage
                   cout << MemUsage() now works similar to cout << TimeStamp();

 3.4.1 971215 mro changed abkfatal and abkassert so that they clean
                  up seeds.out before crashing program.
 3.4.2 980213 ilm  renamed into abkio.h
              ilm  added printRange()

 3.5   980303 ilm  added all_call_debugger()

 3.5.1 980306 ilm  added pathDelims.cxx

 3.5.5 980313 ilm  fixed const-correctness in paramproc.{h,cxx}

 3.6   980319 ilm  added listO1size.h
                   it is not included into abkcommon.h through

 3.7   980320 ilm  added abkfatal2() ,  abkfatal3() and 6 other "2"s and "3"s
                   asserting IO manipulators now require lineNo argument

 3.8   980426  dv  added abkGcd function. Added file abkfunc.h for function
                   templates in future.

 4.0   980802 ilm  added CPUNormalizer, Sysinfo. 
                   shurnk stream output from Timer
                   added normalized CPU time to the output of Timer 
 4.1   980826 ilm/mm MemUsage() fixed for Solaris2.6 and made robust

 4.2   990208 ilm  added abkversion.h that defines the PRINT_VERSION_INFO macro
                   modified Makefile to pass additional info to this macro
                   added main15.cxx to demonstrate PRINT_VERSION_INFO 
                   Tested with gcc2.91 and SUN Pro CC4.2, see abkversion.h
                   for more information
 4.3   990215  yu  added comments for doc++ in the *.h files 
                   added "inline" before the delarations of inline member 
                   functions in abktimer.h 
 4.5   990227  yu  change comments for Perceps
 
 4.8   990816  ilm ported to g++, except for system-dependent details
 4.9   990816  ilm system-dependent extensions for g++/Solaris and g++/Linux
                   Time reporting fixed on all platforms.
                   Memory/Platform/User reporting have been extended 
                   to g++/Solaris, but not yet to g++/Linux.
                   abk_call_debugger() and abk_dump_stack() are not
                   completely supported with g++/gdb yet.
 4.9.2 990906  ilm finished porting abk_call_debugger(), abk_dump_stack()
                   Ported MemUsage(), Platform() and User().
                   Modified abk_dump_stack() and abk_call_debugger()
                   to print full paths of shared libs used (a dream come true?)
                   Changed __SUNPRO_CC__ to sun and __GNUC__ to linux where
                   appropriate.
 5.1.1 000501  ilm, mro 
                   Finished porting to CC5.0, added sgi_stl_compat.h

 5.1.3         mro random_shuffle removed from sgi_stl_compat.h because
                   it is not an SGI extension.  Use std::random_shuffle
                   in client code.
 5.4  020824   ilm ported to g++ 3.1.1
               ilm fixed to abkguess3()

03/28/2020 cherry remove all sgi hash code, abklimiits.h
