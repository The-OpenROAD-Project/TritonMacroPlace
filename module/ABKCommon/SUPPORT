  The text of this advisory is to be used for information purposes only.

  Developers and/or maintainers will attempt to provide installation
  instructions, describe the general purpose of released source codes
  and executables as well as provide relevant references (e.g., to
  technical reports and conference papers). However, providing
  comprehensive documentation may be impossible due to resource/funding
  limitations.

  Realizing this, developers will provide limited and selective support
  for the released source code and executables by electronic or regular mail.
  This advisory encourages all users to request additional documentation,
  instructions and clarifications. Developers will attempt to answer such
  requests as time allows, establish mailing lists for users and maintain
  answers for Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ). Users are encouraged to read
  such lists and other available documentation prior to requesting support.

            In particular, it lists various papers describing algorithms
            implemented (more papers are available at
                         http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/PDtools/#PUBS).
